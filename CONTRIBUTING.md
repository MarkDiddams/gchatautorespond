# Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

In exchange for what I feel is a meaningful contribution, I'd be happy to waive your subscription fee.
I'm unlikely to do that for, say, fixing a typo; I'm picturing bugfixes, new features, or significant UI improvements.
Feel free to reach out in advance if you have questions.
